          <h4>Project Overview</h4>
          <p>The owner, Rich Dolan, didn’t have a site yet and needed one soon as he was also opening up a new store soon.</p>
          <p>His target audience are people from downtown Phoenix up to Indian School Road.  His requirements were a fun serendipitous site that matched the energy of his shop.  His other main concern was having the ability to update the flavors that he has in the shop to the site with ease of use in mind.  He also wanted the ability to purchase gift cards online.</p>

          <h4>Design & User Experience</h4>
          <p>I wanted the website design to reflect the fun and funky atmosphere of Lix Uptown Ice Cream shop. The site is both informative and visually appealing.</p>
          <p>The user experience was important, so I made sure the menu bar is always visible and shrinks as you scroll down. The entire site is on one page because it focuses on the ice cream flavors, the unique environment, and social media content like Instagram images and reviews.</p>

          <h4>Challenges & Problem Solving</h4>
          <p>I faced challenges accessing the required API key for Instagram to stream information into the website. However, through patience and diligence, I found a solution. Now, Rich Dolan can effortlessly upload pictures to Instagram, and they will automatically appear on the website.</p>
          <p>I faced the challenge of integrating Stripe, a payment platform, and implementing a customizable gift card pricing feature. It was a new problem for me, but I managed to find a solution. Now, customers can choose the amount they want to put on the gift card instead of being limited to a fixed price.</p>
          <p>My favorite challenge was making the flavors on the clipboards editable without going into the code.  This allows Rich to concentrate more on creating his epic ice cream flavors and not on tedious work.  A couple clicks, and type the new flavor in and push Update.  Now profit.</p>
